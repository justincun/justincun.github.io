# Predicting Financial Markets with Wisdom of the Crowd
#### by Justin Cun & Dakshh Saraf

## Introduction - What is wisdom of the crowd?

The concept of the wisdom of the crowd pertains to the collective opinion of a diverse and independent group of individuals, as opposed to relying solely on the expertise of a single individual. Popular social information websites such as Reddit, Quora, and Stack Exchange draw upon this collective knowledge of the crowd. An explanation for this phenomenon is that each person's judgment has some unique bias or noise, but by averaging the responses of a large number of people, we can cancel out this noise and arrive at a more reliable conclusion. This approach can be used and tested in several instances, like financial markets. More specifically, the wisdom of the crowd may be a viable methodlogy for predicting financial markets.
